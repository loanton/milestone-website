                <h2>about me</h2>
                <h3>I am passionate about the web.</h3>
                <p>I started taking Skillcrush classes after getting recommendations from my cat.  Without her constant encouragement I would have never made it to be a purrfessional Web Developer.  One day I will make the internet a safe place for all cats, where no cat will fear being meme-ified and exploited for their cuteness.</p>
                <p>Can't wait to work with you!</p>
